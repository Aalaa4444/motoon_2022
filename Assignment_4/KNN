Disadvantages of KNN

1. Does not work well with large dataset:
In large datasets, the cost of calculating the distance between the new point and each existing points is huge which degrades the performance of the algorithm.

2. Does not work well with high dimensions:
The KNN algorithm doesn't work well with high dimensional data because with large number of dimensions, it becomes difficult for the algorithm to calculate the distance in each dimension.

3. Need feature scaling:
We need to do feature scaling (standardization and normalization) before applying KNN algorithm to any dataset. If we don't do so, KNN may generate wrong predictions.

4. Sensitive to noisy data, missing values and outliers:
KNN is sensitive to noise in the dataset. We need to manually impute missing values and remove outliers.
