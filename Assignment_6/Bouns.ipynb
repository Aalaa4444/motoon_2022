    "<li> What is the disadvantages of the KNN classifier</li>\n",
    "1. Does not work well with large dataset:\n",
    "In large datasets, the cost of calculating the distance between the new point and each existing points is huge which degrades the performance of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Does not work well with high dimensions:\n",
    "The KNN algorithm doesn't work well with high dimensional data because with large number of dimensions, it becomes difficult for the algorithm to calculate the distance in each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Need feature scaling:\n",
    "We need to do feature scaling (standardization and normalization) before applying KNN algorithm to any dataset. If we don't do so, KNN may generate wrong predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sensitive to noisy data, missing values and outliers:\n",
    "KNN is sensitive to noise in the dataset. We need to manually impute missing values and remove outliers.\n",
    "<li> How to optimize the KNN algorithm</li>\n",
    "for a given test sample x:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - find K most similar samples from training set, according to similarity measure s\n",
    "\n",
    "   - return the majority vote of the class from the above set\n",
    "   \n",
    "Consequently the only thing used to define KNN besides K is the similarity measure s, and that's all. There is literally nothing else in this algorithm (as it has 3 lines of pseudocode). On the other hand finding \"the best similarity measure\" is equivalently hard problem as learning a classifier itself, thus there is no real method of doing so, and people usually end up using either simple things (Euclidean distance) or use their domain knowledge to adapt s to the problem at hand.\n",
